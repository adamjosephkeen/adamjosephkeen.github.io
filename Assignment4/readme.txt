Assignment 4; In assignment 4, we took our basic html code from Assignment 2 and improved it via Css. I added things such as borders, margins, paddings, alignments, and images to improve the look of this site. I feel like my skills in css are improving and I am excited to move forward with more advanced techniques. My code passed both validators. The assignment can be found at weblab.cs.uml.edu/~akeen/Assignment4/index.html
