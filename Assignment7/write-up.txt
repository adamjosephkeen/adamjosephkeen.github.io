In Assignment 7, I had trouble getting the required validation information to appear to the screen. My main issue was that the table from Assignment 6 was being generated with an OnClick() function. So, I attempted to change that function to occur when the form was submitted. I was unable to do that becasue the way my function was working was appending HTML code to the body. From my understanding, the form validator only works when the form is submitted, and in my program, when the form was submitted, it would reset the original HTML code and only flash my table then erase it. I struggled mightily with this and spend a long time trying to fix it, but was unable to. I tried changing the validate function to occur when the process button is clicked rather than when the form is submitted, but had no luck there either. I put in some code that I believe would work with the jQuery validation, but was unable to get anything to work in my program. Thank you.
